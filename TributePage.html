              Here's a list of Xander's achievements in <em>Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest</em>, alongside his small force of elite troops and royal siblings.
            </h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Chapter 16 (Join Chapter)</strong> - Defeated Shura's brigand ninjas aboard the ship to Hoshidan territory. Approved the decision to kill Shura for his movement-increasing Boots</li>
              <li><strong>Chapter 17</strong> - Determined the Mokushu ninjas to be dishonorable, and thus unfit allies for Nohr. Killed their leader and daimyo, Kotaro, who had insisted on playing dirty by holding Hoshidans hostage.</li>
              <li><strong>Chapter 18</strong> - Saved the Hoshidan royals from Zola's underhanded plot in the neutral territory of Izumo. Xander would not tolerate murdering his enemies unarmed in a neutral space, even if doing so would cripple the opposing
                nation. There was no honor in that. Confronted Ryoma, High Prince of Hoshido before going their separate ways.</li>
