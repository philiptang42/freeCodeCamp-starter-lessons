            <h3>
              Here's a list of Xander's achievements in <em>Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest</em>, alongside his small force of elite troops and royal siblings.
            </h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Chapter 16 (Join Chapter)</strong> - Defeated Shura's brigand ninjas aboard the ship to Hoshidan territory. Approved the decision to kill Shura for his movement-increasing Boots</li>
              <li><strong>Chapter 17</strong> - Determined the Mokushu ninjas to be dishonorable, and thus unfit allies for Nohr. Killed their leader and daimyo, Kotaro, who had insisted on playing dirty by holding Hoshidans hostage.</li>
              <li><strong>Chapter 18</strong> - Saved the Hoshidan royals from Zola's underhanded plot in the neutral territory of Izumo. Xander would not tolerate murdering his enemies unarmed in a neutral space, even if doing so would cripple the opposing
                nation. There was no honor in that. Confronted Ryoma, High Prince of Hoshido before going their separate ways.</li>
              <li><strong>Chapter 19</strong> - Hoping to avoid the bulk of the Hoshidan army, Xander's forces take another path through the mountains. They encounter the lair of the Kitsune, a village of fox-like creatures. Their unfortunate hostility leads to a battle where Xander and friends devastate the Kitsune.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Chapter 20</strong> - Continuing through the mountains, Xander's party encounters the Wind Tribe. The Chieftain, Fuga, does not allow them to pass without a test of might. And so Xander wiped the floor with the entire Wind Tribe.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Chapter 21</strong> - Xander's group climbs the Eternal Stairway and proves its name wrong as they reach the top. Along the way, he killed a million Faceless enemies that barred the path.</li>
              <li><strong>Chapter 22</strong> - Nearing the Hoshidan Capitol, Xander's forces conquer Fort Jinya, defeating the late queen's advisor Yukimura and youngest of the Hoshidan royal family, Sakura.</li>
              <li><strong>Chapter 23</strong> - Xander's units capture the Great Wall of Suzanoh after overcoming massive resistance in the form of Prince Takumi's defenses. He was defeated and thrown off the wall, his wellbeing a myster as his corpse was never found.</li>
              <li><strong>Chapter 24</strong> - Approaching Shirasagi Castle, Xander decimates the Pegasus Knights, the last bastion of Hoshidan defenses that guard the castle entrance. Among the defenders is Princess Hinoka, eldest daughter of the Hoshidan royals. She is defeated soundly, but allowed to live on the condition that she leaves quietly.</li>
              <li><strong>Chapter 25</strong> - Xander, along with the entire Nohrian army, overrun Shirasagi castle and confront High Prince of Hoshido Ryoma. After suffering defeat, the prince commits honorable suicide, ending the last of the Hoshidan resistance.</li>
              resistance.</li>
              <li><strong>Chapter 26</strong> - The royal family are convinced that King Garon has gone insane, and thus turn treason against him. To start, they kill his advisor Iago outside the throne room, along with a massive portion of the Nohrian invading force.</li>
              <li><strong>Chapter 27</strong> - What a twist, King Garon was actually some crazy blob monster all along. At first, Xander and the Nohrian royalty were in absolute shock at this revelation and couldn't bring themselves to kill their father. But then the blob monster swung at everyone with his axe on a stretched out slime limb. Xander and co. kill him.</li>
              <li><strong>Endgame</strong> - With King Garon dead - or at least the slime entity that had consumed him - Xander could now ascend to throne and take Nohr into a new era, a new course. However, Prince Takumi, who fallen off the Great Wall earlier, appeared at the door to the throne room and attacked. Wielding the corrupted bow Skadi, he seemed unstoppable. Hell, he even cloned himself. And could charge up a projectile that strikes an entire army at once for heavy damage. It was hopeless...that is, until, Xander trudged all the way from the throne to the entrance, blasted through mysterious reinforcements, and slew Takumi with a critical strike.</li>
              <li><strong>Epilogue</strong> - Xanders claims his birthright by ascending to the throne, becoming king of Nohr. He promises to lead Nohr in a new, brighter direction. The matter of who or what possessed his father is never resolved. Relations with Hoshido were still strained coming fresh off the war, but their new ruler Queen Hinoka is willing to negotiate
